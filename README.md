# mina_pharma_task_movie

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Movies Flutter application.

--------------------------
in this project I consider/use:

clean arch
clean code
solid principles
dependency injection (DI)

bloc state management
working with APIs
caching data offline
UI/UX principles

git
github
------------------------






------------------------
DEV. NOTE!

as this project was developed for a simple task for interview purposes, 
this project in seemed to be somehow over-engineered! but i consider it
as if it was just a small piece of a complete movies app  if the app was
just an app to show some movies titles and images for example I would use
provider (instead of bloc) as my state management solution as
it's more suitable for small and medium projects in my opinion.
And would also use, may be, MVP for example instead of clean-arch for
architecting project's files and classes as being more too much simpler
for implementing for small size projects without overkilling.

hand on @ 3:00pm Wed. 7th of Dec.
hand up @ 1:16am Sun. 11th of Dec.

I'm not happy or satisfied with the state of the app there are still a lot that I should do more. 
I couldn't give it the needed time because of some sudden family that I had to care of for all the
task givin time. But any way I worked hard though and tried to finish
as much as I could during these 3 days
Thanks for understanding...
